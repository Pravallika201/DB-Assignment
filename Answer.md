1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the given diagram.

The "Product" and "Product_Category" entities are related through the "category_id" attribute in the "Product" entity. This implies a one-to-many relationship between "Product_Category" and "Product".
The "category_id" attribute in the "Product" entity serves as a reference to the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" entity. This establishes a one-to-many relationship where each product belongs to one product category, and each product category can have multiple products associated with it. This arrangement allows for the categorization and organization of products within the system.




2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

By enforcing a foreign key constraint, we ensure that each product in the "Product" table must have a valid category assigned to it. This helps maintain data integrity and consistency within the database schema.

Foreign Key Constraint:
The "category_id" attribute in the "Product" table should be defined as a foreign key that references the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table.
This constraint ensures that the value entered in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must exist as a primary key value in the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table.
